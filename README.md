## About Me:
I have 15 years of hands-on experience developing and scaling high-quality software QA teams across startups, agencies, and enterprise-level companies. My work appears across software products from Activision, Boeing, Evergreen Exhibits, Intel, Harbor Freight Tools, and many more.

Most recently, my work included applied AI initiatives: custom GPTs, RAG pipelines, and custom-built deterministic prediction models that drive measurable business impact.
